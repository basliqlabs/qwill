The **20th century** was a defining era for the development of **modern management**, shaped by industrial growth, wars, globalization, and technological change.

## Early 20th Century (1900–1930s): Scientific Management and Bureaucracy

The 1900–1930 era marks the birth of modern management theory. This period laid the scientific and structural foundation for how organizations would be run throughout the 20th century and beyond.

### 1. Scientific Management (Taylorism) – Frederick W. Taylor

Taylor believed that productivity could be vastly improved if work was analyzed and optimized like a machine. His approach was **mechanistic** but revolutionary at the time.

#### Main Principles

1. Scientific Job Design:

   - Break each job into **small tasks**.
   - Determine the "one best way" to perform each task using **time and motion studies**.

2. Scientific Selection and Training:

   - Hire workers with the **right abilities**.
   - Train them to perform the tasks **exactly as prescribed**.

3. Performance-Based Pay (Incentives):

   - Reward workers based on productivity (piece-rate systems).

4. Separation of Planning and Doing:

   - Managers plan and design work.
   - Workers simply execute.

#### Real-World Impact

- Applied in factories (e.g., Ford’s assembly line).
- Boosted productivity significantly.
- Criticized for treating humans like machines, ignoring motivation and creativity.

### 2. Administrative Management (Henri Fayol, France)

While Taylor focused on the **shop floor**, Fayol focused on the **management structure** of the entire organization.

#### Fayol’s 5 Functions of Management

1. **Planning** – Setting goals and a course of action.
2. **Organizing** – Arranging resources and tasks.
3. **Commanding (Leading)** – Giving orders and direction.
4. **Coordinating** – Aligning activities and departments.
5. **Controlling** – Monitoring and correcting performance.

#### Fayol’s 14 Principles of Management

Some notable ones:

- **Division of work**: Specialization improves efficiency.
- **Authority and responsibility**: Managers must have power and be accountable.
- **Unity of command**: One employee = one supervisor.
- **Scalar chain**: Clear hierarchy from top to bottom.
- **Order**: A place for everything and everyone.
- **Esprit de corps**: Promote team spirit and unity.

:::

> [!tip] **Esprit de corps** (noun)
> a feeling of pride and mutual loyalty shared by the members of a group.

:::

#### Real-World Impact

- Fayol’s work became foundational for **organizational theory**.
- His ideas are still reflected in **modern organizational charts** and management roles.

### 3. Bureaucratic Management (Max Weber, Germany)

Weber observed that traditional and charismatic forms of authority (like monarchs or personal influence) were unstable. He proposed **rational-legal authority** via **bureaucracy** as the most efficient and fair system.

#### Features of a Bureaucratic Organization

1. **Formal Hierarchy** - Clear chain of command and levels of authority.

2. **Division of Labor** - Specialized roles and responsibilities.

3. **Rules and Regulations** - Consistent and impersonal guidelines.

4. **Impersonality** - Decisions based on rules, not personal relationships.

5. **Merit-Based Advancement** - Promotions based on qualifications and performance.

#### Purpose

- Bureaucracy was meant to ensure **efficiency, stability, and fairness**.
- It replaced nepotism and favoritism with **predictable and standardized systems**.

#### Criticisms

- Can become overly rigid or inefficient.
- "Red tape" and lack of innovation.

:::

> [!tip] **Red Tape** (noun)
> excessive bureaucracy or adherence to official rules and formalities.

## Mid-20th Century (1930s–1950s): Human Relations and Organizational Behavior

The 1930–1950 era marks a major **shift from mechanical views of work to a focus on human psychology, behavior, and motivation** in the workplace. This period birthed the Human Relations Movement and laid the foundation for organizational behavior and modern HR practices.

### 4. Hawthorne Studies (Elton Mayo and Fritz Roethlisberger, USA)

- Conducted at **Western Electric’s Hawthorne Plant** in Chicago (1924–1932).
- Originally aimed to study how **lighting** affected productivity.

#### Key Experiments and Surprising Findings

1. Illumination Studies:

   - Productivity increased **regardless** of whether lighting was improved or worsened.
   - Conclusion: Something **other than physical conditions** was at play.

2. Relay Assembly Test Room:

   - Small group of women were isolated, had more freedom, and were observed.
   - Output increased even when conditions worsened.
   - Workers felt **special attention**, creating motivation — now called the **Hawthorne Effect**.

3. Bank Wiring Observation Room:

   - Found **informal group norms** limited productivity to avoid being outliers.
   - Peer pressure and social dynamics influenced behavior more than incentives.

#### Key Takeaways

- **Psychological and social factors matter** in the workplace.
- Employees aren’t just economic units—they're **social beings**.
- Informal group dynamics, recognition, and morale affect performance.

### 5. Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs (Abraham Maslow, USA, 1943)

Maslow proposed that human needs are arranged in a **hierarchical pyramid**. People are motivated to satisfy lower needs before moving to higher ones.

#### The Hierarchy

1. **Physiological Needs**: Food, water, sleep
2. **Safety Needs**: Security, job stability, health
3. **Belongingness**: Friendship, relationships, teamwork
4. **Esteem**: Achievement, respect, recognition
5. **Self-Actualization**: Reaching one’s potential, creativity

#### Management Implications

- **One-size-fits-all incentives don’t work**.
- Managers must understand **where employees are** on the hierarchy.
- Raises and bonuses may not matter if **belonging or esteem needs** are unmet.

### 6. Douglas McGregor – Theory X and Theory Y (1957–1960)

Douglas McGregor introduced two contrasting theories of how managers view employees.

#### Theory X (Traditional View)

- People **dislike work** and avoid it if possible.
- Must be **coerced, controlled, or threatened** to perform.
- Prefer to be directed, avoid responsibility.

**Result**: Authoritarian management, tight supervision, micromanagement.

#### Theory Y (Modern View)

- Work is **natural**, and people seek responsibility.
- They are **self-motivated** when committed to objectives.
- Creativity and problem-solving are widespread.

**Result**: Participative management, empowerment, coaching style.

#### Impact

- Encouraged **trust-based leadership** and **employee development**.
- Supported by growing evidence from **Hawthorne and Maslow**.

> [!note] Why "X" and "Y"?
> The names Theory X and Theory Y were coined by Douglas McGregor not because "X" and "Y" stand for anything specific, but for a neutral and contrasting labeling of two fundamentally different assumptions about human behavior in the workplace.
>
> - McGregor wanted to avoid judgmental or emotional terms like "bad/good" or "old/new."
> - The use of letters allowed him to objectively describe two alternative managerial mindsets without implying that one is superior (even though he clearly favored Theory Y).

## Post-War Era (1950s–1970s): Systems, Quantitative, and Strategic Thinking

The 1950–1970 era in management was shaped by **systems thinking, quantitative analysis**, and a broader view of how organizations interact with their environments. It was a time of cold war science, corporate expansion, and management becoming more strategic and data-driven.

### 7. Operations Research & Quantitative Management

It was originated during **World War II** to solve military logistics and resource problems and it was being utilized by the Allies to **optimize radar placement, convoy scheduling, supply chains**, etc. After the war, businesses adopted these **analytical methods** to make better decisions.

#### Concepts

- **Mathematical modeling** of business problems.
- Use of **statistics, probability, and optimization**.
- Applied to:
  - Inventory control (e.g., Economic Order Quantity model)
  - Queuing theory (e.g., call centers, customer service)
  - Linear programming (e.g., how to maximize output given constraints)

#### Management Shift

- Rise of the “manager as decision scientist”.
- Inspired the creation of Management Information Systems (MIS) and early computer systems.
- Great for efficiency and precision, but **critics said it ignored human behavior**.

### 8. Systems Theory (Ludwig von Bertalanffy, Kenneth Boulding, et al.)

System Theory denotes that organizations are **open systems** that constantly interact with their environment.
Rather than viewing departments as **isolated silos**, systems theory says: "Every part of an organization is **interdependent** and contributes to the overall goal."

#### Key Characteristics of Systems

1. **Inputs** – Resources like people, capital, materials
2. **Processes** – Workflows, operations
3. **Outputs** – Products, services
4. **Feedback loops** – Performance evaluation, learning, adaptation

:::

**Closed system**: Doesn't interact with the environment (e.g., a machine).

**Open system**: Interacts and adapts (e.g., a business responding to market trends).

:::

#### Management Implications

- Must understand the whole organization and its context.
- Encouraged cross-functional coordination and adaptive planning.

**Systems theory helped management move away from rigid structures and embrace flexibility and complexity**.

### 9. Management by Objectives (Peter Drucker)

A method where managers and employees **jointly set goals**, and performance is evaluated against these objectives.

#### Key Elements

1. Cascading goals: Company → Department → Individual
2. Clear performance metrics
3. Employee participation in goal setting
4. Regular reviews and feedback

#### Why It Mattered

- Empowered employees with a sense of **purpose**.
- Shifted management from controlling to **coaching and aligning**.
- Introduced the idea that **“what gets measured gets managed.”**

MBO inspired modern practices like **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)**, used by Intel and Google.

## Late 20th Century (1970s–1990s): Globalization, Quality, and Agile Thinking

### 10. Total Quality Management (TQM)

In the 1970s and 1980s, companies around the world, especially in Japan, began to see **quality** not as a final checkpoint, but as a **continuous, organization-wide effort**. This philosophy became known as **Total Quality Management (TQM)** and was led by thinkers like **W. Edwards Deming**, **Joseph Juran**, and **Kaoru Ishikawa**.

TQM emphasized that every employee—regardless of role—should contribute to improving processes and customer satisfaction. It promoted a culture of **ongoing, incremental improvement**, or _Kaizen_, and sought to build systems that **prevent errors** rather than catch them after they happen.

:::

> Kaizen is a Japanese word that can be translated to mean change for the better.

:::

Some core principles of TQM include:

- **Customer focus** – Quality is defined by the customer’s expectations.
- **Process improvement** – Fix the system, not the worker.
- **Data-driven decisions** – Use facts and analysis, not assumptions.
- **Employee involvement** – Empower teams to solve quality problems.

TQM became a backbone of Japanese manufacturing success and later influenced global practices such as **Lean** and **Six Sigma**.

### 11. Strategic Management and Competitive Advantage

During the 1980s, as markets matured and global competition intensified, businesses realized that internal efficiency alone wasn’t enough—they needed **strategic clarity**. This is where **strategic management** came into focus, especially through the work of **Michael Porter**.

Porter introduced frameworks that helped companies analyze their competitive environment. The most famous is the **Five Forces Model**, which looks at:

- Competitive rivalry
- Threat of new entrants
- Threat of substitutes
- Bargaining power of suppliers
- Bargaining power of customers

He also identified **three generic strategies** to achieve a competitive edge:

- **Cost leadership** – Be the low-cost producer.
- **Differentiation** – Offer unique value that competitors can’t match.
- **Focus** – Target a narrow market better than anyone else.

Strategic management taught companies to look **outward at their environment**, not just inward at operations. It also inspired tools like **SWOT analysis** and **value chain analysis**, making strategy a regular part of executive thinking.

### 12. Organizational Culture and Change Management

By the late 20th century, leaders began to understand that **structures and strategies alone don’t ensure success**—it’s the people, beliefs, and behaviors that truly shape outcomes. This led to a growing interest in **organizational culture** and **change management**.

**Edgar Schein** was a major voice here. He described culture as existing on three levels:

- **Artifacts** – Observable symbols like dress code or office layout.
- **Espoused values** – What the organization says it values.
- **Underlying assumptions** – Deep, often unconscious beliefs.

At the same time, **Kurt Lewin** and later **John Kotter** explored how change works inside organizations. Kotter proposed a famous **8-step model** for successful change, starting with creating urgency and ending with anchoring new behaviors into the culture.

Change management became essential in a world of constant disruption. It reminded managers that **people don’t resist change itself**, but **poorly managed change**.

### 13. Lean Thinking and Agile Practices

In the final decades of the 20th century, businesses began shifting from rigid, slow systems toward **flexibility, speed, and customer responsiveness**. Two key movements emerged: **Lean** (from manufacturing) and **Agile** (from software development).

**Lean thinking** was developed by **Toyota**, especially through the work of **Taiichi Ohno**. It focused on:

- **Eliminating waste** (time, materials, effort)
- **Just-in-time production**
- **Continuous improvement (Kaizen)**
- **Respect for workers** as problem-solvers

> [!note] Agile in Software Development
> Meanwhile, in the software world, developers grew frustrated with long, inflexible processes. They began using **short cycles**, **team collaboration**, and **frequent feedback**, which evolved into **Agile**. The **Agile Manifesto**, published in 2001 but shaped in the 1990s, emphasized:
>
> - Working software over documentation
> - Collaboration over contracts
> - Adaptability over rigid plans

Together, Lean and Agile reshaped modern work by promoting **speed, learning, and empowered teams**, setting the stage for how tech companies—and eventually all companies—would operate in the 21st century.
